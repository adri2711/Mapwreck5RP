(DONT DELETE THIS FILE)

# Contributing to the Resourcepack

1. Get added to the repo - include your GitHub account in the signup or message @Asometric#2711.

2. Clone the repo (If you're here you probably already did this!)

3. Before modifying anything, make a new branch (In Github Desktop: Branch > New Branch) and name it after your team.

4. Add your item textures to the folder inside of assets that matches your area. (For example, area 5 textures would go in Mapwreck5/assets/area_5/textures). You can ignore the models file.
For anything that isn't item textures, contact RockNRed#0001. Once you've added them, commit your changes and push to origin.

Please follow this custom model data naming convention:
Custom Model Data will have the following format: AAXXX where X = Item Number and A = Area number. Item texture 14 of area 3 will have custom model data 3014 and texture 8 of area 12 12008. Leading 0s such as in 03 need to be removed.

!!! IMPORTANT !!! Texture names must include id and custom model data of the item. For example iron_pickaxe_3014 or stick_12008.

5. To submit your changes, create a pull request (Branch > Create Pull Request). A browser tab will open for it. Once you've created it, an organiser will review it and add it into the main branch of the pack.
